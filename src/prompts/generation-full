You are a top of the class C# programmer with a strong background in cryptography and computer security.
You will receive specification for a software that must be written in C# and .NET core in a Windows operating system.
Proceeds in steps. 
Basedirectory is: C:\temp\experiments
You will answer with a general brief explanation of implementation choices, followed by a code box containing shell commands to initialize solution and project structure as well as all the nuget install commands. Specify the version of the framework you want to use in the dotnet new command. 
Finally complete the answer with the numbered list of files to implement the software.
Then start listing code files content in a code box preceded by a single line containing full path of the file using BaseDirectory.

Specifications
"""
A .NET library to easy working with cryptographic .NET core primitives. We need methods to manage key: Create Update Load Deleted for both AES and RSA. We need helpers to encrypt / decrypt streams as well encrypt decrypt plain string to encrypted string and vice versa. We need code to manage keys in a local folder as well as with Azure Key Vault for increase security.

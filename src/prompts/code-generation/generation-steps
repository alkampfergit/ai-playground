Specifications
"""
A .NET library to easy working with cryptographic .NET core primitives. We need methods to manage key: Create Update Load Deleted for both AES and RSA. We need helpers to encrypt / decrypt streams as well encrypt decrypt plain string to encrypted string and vice versa. We need code to manage keys in a local folder as well as with Azure Key Vault for increase security.

Injection: Injection flaws occur when an attacker can send untrusted data to an interpreter that can execute unintended commands or access unauthorized data. This can result in data loss, corruption, or unauthorized access to sensitive information.\\n\\n2. Broken Authentication and Session Management: This vulnerability occurs when an application does not properly authenticate users or manage their sessions. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to user accounts or sensitive data.\\n\\n3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): XSS vulnerabilities occur when an attacker can inject malicious code into a web page that is then executed by a victim's browser. This can result in the theft of sensitive data or the compromise of user accounts.\\n\\n4. Broken Access Control: This vulnerability occurs when an application does not properly restrict access to sensitive resources. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality.\\n\\n5. Security Misconfiguration: This vulnerability occurs when an application is not configured securely. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality.\\n\\n6. Insecure Cryptographic Storage: This vulnerability occurs when an application stores sensitive data in an insecure manner. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.\\n\\n7. Insufficient Logging and Monitoring: This vulnerability occurs when an application does not log or monitor security events. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality.\\n\\n8. Insecure Communication: This vulnerability occurs when an application communicates over an insecure channel. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to intercept sensitive data or modify data in transit.\\n\\n9. Broken Function Level Authorization: This vulnerability occurs when an application does not properly restrict access to functionality based on user roles or privileges. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality.\\n\\n10.

      "Sure, here are the top 10 OWASP vulnerabilities for web applications:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Injection: Injection flaws, such as SQL, NoSQL, OS, and LDAP injection, occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker's hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Broken Authentication and Session Management: Applications frequently fail to protect sensitive information, such as authentication credentials and session tokens, due to improper authentication and session management.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): XSS flaws occur whenever an application includes untrusted data in a new web page without proper validation or escaping, allowing attackers to execute scripts in the victim's browser that can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect the user to malicious sites.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Broken Access Control: Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are not properly enforced. Attackers can exploit these flaws to access unauthorized functionality and/or data, such as access other users' accounts, view sensitive files, modify other users' data, change access rights, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Security Misconfiguration: Security misconfiguration is the most commonly seen issue. This is commonly a result of insecure default configurations, incomplete or ad hoc configurations, open cloud storage, misconfigured HTTP headers, and verbose error messages containing sensitive information.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Insecure Cryptographic Storage: Many web applications do not properly protect sensitive data, such as credit cards, passwords, and session tokens, with appropriate encryption or hashing.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Insufficient Transport Layer Protection: Applications frequently fail to authenticate, encrypt, and protect the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive network traffic. This includes unprotected communications, poor or absent encryption, and weak configuration of SSL/TLS.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Insufficient Authorization: Authorization flaws occur when an application does not properly restrict access to resources or functionality based on user roles or privileges.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities: Components, such as libraries, frameworks, and other software modules, almost always run with full privileges. If a vulnerable component is exploited, such an attack can facilitate serious data loss or server takeover.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Insufficient Logging and Monitoring: Insufficient logging and monitoring, coupled with missing or ineffective integration with incident response, allows attackers to further attack systems, maintain persistence, pivot to more systems, and tamper, extract, or destroy data.\n",
